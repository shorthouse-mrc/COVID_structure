Files for reproducing Alpha Variant mutational combinations in FoldX.

The file "Alpha_variant_mutations.txt" contains mutations present in the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2. 

Mutational energies are calculated by running the "Foldx_variant_combinations_calculation.py" file as follows:

$python Foldx_variant_combinations_calculation.py Alpha_variant_mutations.txt 6vxx_preRepair_Repair.pdb

The output will be a series of folders containing the combinations. To get all of the energy combinations run the analysis script:

$python Foldx_summarize.py

The zip file "Compressed_variant_files.zip" contain an example output from the calcualtion on the Alpha variant (not expanded here due to the large number of files)
